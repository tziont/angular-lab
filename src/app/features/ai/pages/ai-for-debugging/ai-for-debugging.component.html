  <h1>AI for Debugging and Problem Solving</h1>

  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      In this sub-topic, we explore how Artificial Intelligence can assist developers
      in identifying, understanding, and resolving code-related problems.  
      Debugging is one of the most time-consuming parts of software development.
      AI-powered tools can help reduce that time significantly by analyzing error
      messages, suggesting potential fixes, and even monitoring applications for
      runtime issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      We demonstrate two complementary approaches:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>AI as a Debugging Assistant</strong> — where the developer pastes
        an error message or problematic code snippet, and the AI analyzes and
        suggests how to fix it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI as an Automatic Problem Detector</strong> — where the application
        itself detects errors during execution and automatically asks the AI for
        explanations or solutions.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Together, these demos show both the human-assisted and the automated sides of
      AI-driven debugging — a key distinction in modern software engineering.
    </p>

    <h2>Demo 1 — Interactive Debugging Assistant</h2>
    <p>
      In this demo, the user can paste any error message or code snippet that isn’t
      behaving as expected. The AI model simulates an analysis and responds with
      an explanation and a potential solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Demo 2 — Automatic Error Analyzer</h2>
    <p>
      In this demo, the application itself throws an intentional error during
      execution. The AI “observer” listens for runtime errors, captures them, and
      suggests what might be wrong — simulating an intelligent monitoring system.
