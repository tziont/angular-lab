  <h1>Demo 2: AI Debugging (Educational)</h1>
<p>Check console for AI suggestions</p>
  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      This demo is for <strong>learning purposes only</strong>. It shows how a developer might
      integrate AI to analyze a code snippet and an error message.
      <br>
      In real life, developers don’t usually copy-paste code and errors into a component like this.
      This demo is just to understand the process.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developer selects a code snippet and its error</li>
      <li>AI service receives the snippet and error</li>
      <li>AI returns a suggestion or explanation</li>
      <li>Suggestion is logged to the console for the developer</li>
    </ul>
