  <h1>Working with AI Tools in Angular Development</h1>

  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      This section explores how AI tools can support real-world Angular development â€” from generating code scaffolds to debugging and documentation. 
      It focuses on using AI efficiently, verifying its output, and applying it as a productivity booster rather than a replacement for understanding.
