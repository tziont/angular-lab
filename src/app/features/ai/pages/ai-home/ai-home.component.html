  <h1>Working with AI Tools in Angular Development</h1>

  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      This section focuses on using integrated AI tools within your development environment to enhance productivity and code quality in Angular projects.
      You’ll explore how modern AI assistants built into editors like Visual Studio Code — such as GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat, Codeium, or the ChatGPT VS Code extension —
      can generate, explain, and improve Angular code directly inside your workflow.

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand which AI tools can integrate into the Angular development ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Use AI-assisted tools to generate Angular code and refactor existing features.</li>
      <li>Apply AI for debugging, documentation, and testing directly within VS Code.</li>
      <li>Adopt practical AI-driven workflows that speed up development without reducing understanding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommended AI Tools Setup</h2>
    <p>Before starting, make sure you have one or more of the following AI integrations installed in Visual Studio Code:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>  
        <em>Best for real-time code suggestions.</em><br />
        Install from the VS Code Marketplace → <code>GitHub Copilot</code> → Sign in with your GitHub account → Enable in TypeScript and HTML files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Copilot Chat</strong>  
        <em>Ideal for explaining or generating Angular code directly from your editor.</em><br />
        Install the <code>GitHub Copilot Chat</code> extension → open the Chat sidebar → type questions like 
        <code>Explain this component</code> or <code>Generate a service for user management</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Codeium</strong> (free alternative)  
        <em>Good for inline completions and quick suggestions without a GitHub subscription.</em><br />
        Install the <code>Codeium</code> extension → follow the setup instructions → start typing in your Angular files to receive AI-powered completions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ChatGPT Official Extension</strong>  
        <em>Connects directly to ChatGPT inside VS Code.</em><br />
        Install the <code>ChatGPT – Official Plugin</code> → sign in with your OpenAI account → select code and ask for improvements or explanations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each of the following sub-topics demonstrates how to use these tools in practice, with a small Angular example that you can replicate inside your own environment.
