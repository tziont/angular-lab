  <h1>NgRx Effects</h1>

  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      Effects in NgRx let us handle side effects — like API calls, saving to localStorage, or logging — 
      outside of our reducers. This keeps reducers pure and predictable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this demo, when you click “Load Counter,” an effect will simulate an async API call 
      that returns a random number, and updates the store when it completes.
