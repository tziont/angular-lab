  <h1>NgRx Actions</h1>

  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      Actions are plain objects that describe unique events in your application. 
      They are the only way to express that something happened and should trigger a state change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In NgRx, actions are dispatched from components or services and later handled by reducers or effects.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a demo where we define and dispatch an action called <code>increment</code>. 
      The reducer isn’t shown yet, but the demo shows how to wire up the action and dispatch it from a component.
    </p>

    <p>
  Note: This demo updates the counter because we’ve already connected a reducer. 
  Actions by themselves don’t change state — the next section will explain how reducers handle these actions.
