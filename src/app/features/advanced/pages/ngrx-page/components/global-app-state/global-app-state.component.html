  <h1>Global App State Pattern</h1>

  <section class="overview">
    <p>
      In larger applications, state often needs to be shared across multiple features â€” for example, user authentication, global loading indicators, or app-wide settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Global App State Pattern</strong> in NgRx organizes your store into feature slices while maintaining a single global store tree.
      Each slice (like <code>auth</code>, <code>user</code>, or <code>ui</code>) is managed independently but can be combined to represent the overall app state.
