  <h2>RxJS vs Signals Comparison</h2>

  <section class="intro">
    <h3>When to Use Signals vs RxJS</h3>
    <p>
      Both Signals and RxJS are powerful tools for managing state and reactivity in Angular. 
      They can sometimes overlap in use, but they serve different core purposes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Signals</strong> are ideal for <em>local synchronous state</em> inside components or services.</li>
      <li><strong>RxJS</strong> shines in <em>asynchronous and event-based</em> flows — like HTTP calls or streams.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Signals are simpler and integrate directly with Angular change detection, while RxJS gives you more control 
      with operators and streams.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Signals are pull-based — you read them like variables.</li>
      <li>RxJS is push-based — values are emitted over time.</li>
      <li>Use both together for a balanced, scalable architecture.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="example">
    <p>This example shows a service that provides the same counter using both Signals and RxJS.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Signal Count:</strong> {{ counterService.count() }}</p>
      <p><strong>RxJS Count:</strong> {{ rxCount }}</p>

      <button (click)="counterService.increment()">Increment</button>
      <button (click)="counterService.reset()">Reset</button>
