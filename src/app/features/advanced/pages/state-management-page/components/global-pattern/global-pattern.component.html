  <h2>Global App State Pattern</h2>

  <section class="intro">
    <h3>Why Use a Global App State?</h3>
    <p>
      In larger applications, itâ€™s helpful to centralize shared state in a single service. This is similar in spirit to a 
      global store like NgRx, but much lighter. Signals allow us to keep things simple and reactive.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Centralized control over application-wide data</li>
      <li> State can be read and updated from anywhere via DI</li>
      <li> Easier to debug and reason about shared behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This example shows a shared <code>AppStateService</code> that holds multiple signals, such as the current user 
      and theme. Other components can safely access or react to this state without managing it themselves.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>user = signal&lt;User | null&gt;(null)</code></li>
      <li><code>theme = signal('light')</code></li>
      <li>Setter and reset methods for each field</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This example demonstrates a shared app-wide state accessed from a feature component.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p>Theme: {{ appState.theme() }}</p>
      <p>User: {{ appState.user()?.name || 'Anonymous' }}</p>

      <button (click)="appState.toggleTheme()">Toggle Theme</button>
      <button (click)="appState.login({ name: 'Tzion' })">Login</button>
      <button (click)="appState.logout()">Logout</button>
