        Observables are the foundation of reactive programming in Angular. They represent a stream of values
        over time and are used to handle asynchronous operations like user interactions, HTTP requests, and
        more. With Observables, you can subscribe to data changes, transform streams, and compose complex
        workflows in a declarative way.
